A fork of Massimo Calligari's popular QLC+ to add a Remote Focus Unit capability

Some hardware lighting controllers have a hardware widget you can carry around with yourself on stage to issue commands to the system, such as "run this cue" or "set this dimmer to this level".

I find a convenient way to plan my shows is to set up Scenes that are only Pan/Tilt values (and perhaps beam effect values like iris or focus), so that I can use them to set up solo cues with moving lights.  By combining those Scenes with other Scenes that have color and other settings, I can effectively have reusable "position macros."  

Now, finding myself often setting up an event all by myself, it would be useful to have something I could access on a personal device (for me, iOS devices) that would let me activate one of these scenes and edit it.  Ergo, this fork.
